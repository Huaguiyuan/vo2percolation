Percolation model of VO2.

Ground state: atoms are all dimerized, which prevents long-range hopping. 
Atoms can be thermally excited to the metallic state.

Costs energy Delta to move an atom from dimer to metal.
If both atoms in a dimer are moved to the metal, gain back energy V.

Electrons hop within a percolation network of metallic atoms.
Hopping onto dimer sites is renormalized away, leading to nnn hopping within
 the metal.

First step: Ising-like Monte Carlo in atom excitation variables {Nu_i=0, 1}.
Study the formation of the percolation network without including electrons.

Diagonalizing the electron hopping Hamiltonian isn't trivial.  
Need a strategy to estimate whether a configuration of Nu_i's is worth allowing
 before diagonalization.
